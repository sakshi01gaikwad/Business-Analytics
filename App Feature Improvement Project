## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stakeholder feedback for the **FSS App’s Group feature** and transforming it into an actionable improvement backlog using **Agile and Scrum** practices in **Jira**.  

It highlights Business Analysis skills in requirement gathering, backlog creation, user story writing, sprint organization, and version control integration using **GitLab**.

## 🧩 Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR Format)

**Situation:**  
The *Group feature* in the FSS App required functionality improvements based on stakeholder feedback shared in a recorded video and UI Design.  

**Task:**  
Extract and categorize improvement points from the feedback, then structure them into actionable Agile backlog items for the development team, ensuring traceability and alignment between business requirements and version-controlled development tasks.  

**Action:**  
- Reviewed and summarized key feedback from the audio-video session and UI Design.  
- Created a **Scrum project in Jira** to manage the improvement workflow.  
- Translated feedback into **user stories** with clear acceptance criteria.  
- Grouped related stories under **Epics** (e.g., Landing Page, Side Screen).  
- Set up an **initial sprint** to prioritize tasks and assign responsibilities.  
- **Integrated the Jira Scrum board with GitLab**, enabling synchronized issue tracking, commit linkage, and improved visibility between business and technical teams.  

**Result:**  
Delivered a clear, traceable, and collaborative improvement backlog that enhanced coordination between the BA and development teams.  
The integration with GitLab reduced manual updates, ensured consistent version control, and supported real-time tracking of sprint progress.
